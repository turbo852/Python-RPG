# Python-RPG
A text based RPG written in Python

====== Background ======
I started this project because I wanted to learn about Python and I also love the idea of making my own RPG. I found some brief tutorials online and the last project was to make an RPG. After completing all of the tutorials I started on the RPG with a goal of implementing all of the extra challenges that the tutorial listed. I don't remember where I found the tutorial or what the extras were, but I ended up adding a bunch of extra features. However, the next goal is to redesign the RPG to follow an object oriented design.
